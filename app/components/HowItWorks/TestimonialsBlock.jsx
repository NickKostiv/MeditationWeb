      "I meditate daily, especially during the night before going to sleep and saw MeditationMantraSlowdive showing on my facebook feed. I was very impressed with how nice and clean the design is and just love all the features it offers. The only suggestion I would have for the developer and pointed out on other reviews, MeditationMantraSlowdive should offer a 7 day trial for people to see if this works for them.",

    title: "Great and Interesting but I want more",
    content:
      "I‚Äôve used this app a couple times now and I am interested in seeing where this app will grow. I am eager to see more guided meditations with more options (time, voices, areas of focus etc). There are both guided and non-guided meditations offered, but they tend to be generic and wide sweeping. For instance, the full body chakra meditation; there was only one voice that seemed slightly bionic and took me out of focus, the app didn‚Äôt offer additional individual chakra focuses to help me grow, and the voice mentioned genders based on uteruses and arousal which might trigger some people. What I like about this app over other meditative apps is this leans more ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù rather then work and emotion focused. I would like to see this app support spiritual journeys.",
